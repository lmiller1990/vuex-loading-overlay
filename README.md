A simple demo how on to make a Vue progressive loading bar.

I wrote an article about how it works and how to extend it:

TODO:

- better API to allow the user to style the progress bar?
- handle errored requests
- handle more complex scenarios (Iâ€™m sure there are some)
- Handle cancelled requests
